\paragraph{Opposition: Results}
\label{par:oppositionresults}
The opposed thesis presents a wide array of results, often presented in a good way (see figures 5.6-5.9).
These results are testimonial to the conclusions drawn in the document; the methodology of which has previously been elaborated upon.
The results seem applicable and feasible in terms of the described methodology.

However, the results are presented in a two-digit precision manner; a precision not overtly necessary to showcase the presented conclusions.
These results are often presented in percantage form - inducing obscurity into the results due to the high precision (e.g., a percantage of $25\%$ when compared to that of $75\%$ is more lucid than $25.42\%$ compared to $75.03\%$).

For the purposes of readability and to ease interpretation of the results, the author would suggest rounding these measurements to whole numbers.
Such a choice in presentation would render the results less vague and more relatable.
The author believes such an improvement would strengthen the comparability the thesis may have to other works in the area.
