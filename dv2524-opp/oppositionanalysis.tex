% TODO:
% Ought expand upon how the large amounts of time taken to perform the metric analysis may affect use in industry. How often would such a slow operation have to be run?

% At the SICS conference I spoke with systems maintainers that worked with testing of large-scale systems at a large, international, Swedish company.
% He claimed that a large majority of tests used to maintain their systems could rarely be executed due to overhead induced by the massive amounts of tests.
% As such, at said company, severe restrictions would be put in place to restrict in what product-cycle iterations certain tests were performed.
% In this way, tests were performed - depending on their perceived importance - in cycles of daily, weekly, and bi-weekly iterations.
% The tests were often prioritized in accordance to the span of code they tested. As such, simple unit tests would commonly only be executed on a bi-weekly basis.
% This speaks magnitudes of how large overhead induced by wide-spread testing may reach unsustainable levels.
% This is another reason as to why software defect prediction could ensure stability in systems; by improving the priority ranking of tests that ought be run as often as possible.
% I would suggest expanding upon this in the thesis, as to strengthen its academic relevance.
