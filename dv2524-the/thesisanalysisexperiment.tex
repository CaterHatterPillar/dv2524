% Magic instruction profiling (point out that, although tests show no larger impact of just a magic instruction with nops, that magic instruction require to exit hardware aided virtualization, JIT-compilation optimization, and to simply interpret the occurence of a magic instruction. Speculate surrounding how this may affect the outcome)

% TODO:
% Expand upon Phong deviations.

%Deviations caused by rotation of the model may cause, or partly cause, general fluctuation in benchmark (e.g. when paravirtualized). Furthermore, the texturing (or the sampling of, rather) of a rotating small model with such a large texture may cause severe cache misses due to the texture sampling. This is simply speculation, but may cause the major fluctuations in the software rasterized Phong benchmark.
%As such, present suspicions of cache misses and general fluctuations in the Phong benchmark, but point out that the software rasterized Phong benchmark profiling is of less relevance to the paravirtualized sample due to this.
