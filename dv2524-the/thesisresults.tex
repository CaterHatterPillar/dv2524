\section{Histograms}
\label{sec:histograms}
The benchmarking results gathered for the purposes of this study, with the profiling methods having been described in section \dvtcmdrefname{sec:methodologyexperiment_platformprofiling}, are compiled into histograms; visualizing elapsed time in milliseconds to density in the figures presented in this section.
As such, the $Y$ axis showcases sample density; although the axis keys have been removed as they bear little relevance to the outcomes presented in this document.
The histograms each feature \dvtcmdnum{100} bins based off the \dvtcmdnum{1000} samples gathered per benchmark, as described in section \dvtcmdrefname{sec:methodologyexperiment_platformprofiling}, which are rounded into said bins.
For the purposes of good visualization methodology, values outside of the standard deviation\footnote{That is; values above that of the $mean + std$ and values under that of $mean - std$.} are not featured in the figures presented in this section.
In order to accomodate for the, however few, samples outside of said limits the figures are all complemented with key ratio tables (see \todo{Refer to tables} ).
