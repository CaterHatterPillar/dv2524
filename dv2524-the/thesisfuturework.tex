% TODO:
% This chapter ought to outline, inter alia, out-of-scope implementation that was not planned for the purpose of this study. As such, expand upon what the solution is lacking:
% Due to variations in the creation and maintinence of windows in different platforms, incurred by said platforms utilizing different interfaces for the purpose (e.g., \dvttermfedora\ \& \dvttermandroid )
% Use case scenario of existing GL libraries on the host machine - but DX libraries on the target system. Is translation possible (bring up Valve ToGL-project)?
