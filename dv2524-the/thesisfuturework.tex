The solution devised for the purpose of this study may be advanced in a number of ways in order to support higher variations in differing platforms, automation in \dvttermabi\ generation, an array of performance improvements, and general enhancements to make the paravirtualized solution more flexible during maintinence.
Additionally, in consideration to incorporation of a graphics acceleration solution - such as the one presented in this dissertation - into the \dvttermsimics\ full-system simulator, the solution must be improved in terms of cross-platform capabilites.
Recommendations for future work in terms of integration into the \dvttermsimics\ environment is presented in section \dvtcmdrefname{sec:appendixa_simicsproductification} under \dvtcmdrefname{cha:appendixa}.

Below, recommendations for future study, in terms of the experiment performed for the purposes of this thesis, are presented.\\

\noindent
For further studies into paravirtualization as a means to accomodate for graphics acceleration in virtual platforms, the author would like to suggest complementary benchmarking of accelerated graphics performance.
This is due to the benchmarks presented for the purpose of this study having effectively been mini-benchmarks; stressing particular suspected bottlenecks in the solution.
In line with chapter \ref{cha:results} and \ref{cha:conclusion} having concluded paravirtualization as feasible for the means of graphics acceleration in virtual platforms, the methodology ought be profiled further with more verbose benchmarks in order to more effectively establish the magnitude of performance gains a paravirtualized solution may achieve.

Furthermore

% TODO:
% Benchmarking accuracy
% Profiling accuracy
% Profilation of memory table traversal
% Mini-benchmark stressing communication bandwidth, without causing cache misses by redundant rendering.
% Further investigation
% This includes study into the great performance achieved by the QEMU-derived android emulator.

% TODO:
% Use case scenario of existing GL libraries on the host machine - but DX libraries on the target system. Is translation possible (bring up Valve ToGL-project)?
%Speculate surrounding possible use-case in which the target system has DirectX whereas the host machine sits on OpenGL and wants to accelerate target system graphics using paravirtualization.

% Safety Critical solutions:
%A number of possibilities present themselves in terms of safety critical OpenGL utilization, as a paravirtualization can make certain changes to how methods are invoked - without having to modified the application in-and-of-itself. Such a scenario would be to disable all vertex attributes not enabled specifically, each frame.
