%In accordance to said \dvttermreferenceimplementation , this dissertation suggests achieving acceleration of \dvttermopenglestwopointo\ by implementing an acceleration pipeline consisting of three stages that are, in turn, supported by a specialized communications channel in \dvttermsimics .
%Moreover, said communications channel, or '\termsimicspipe ', utilizes a specially devised protocol to describe an assortment of \termopengles\ and \termegl\ function calls when sent in-between the \termhost - and \termtarget\ systems (\dvcmdrefappa{sec:appendixa_simicspipeprotocol}).
