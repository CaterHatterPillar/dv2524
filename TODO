Additions to future work:
* Amend magic instruction overhead by batching invocations.
* * Problem: one must ensure to copy data in case referenced memory changes.
* Perform study without utilizing host virtualization extensions.

Add Threats to Validity section. This section ought to outline the following things:
* Move Phong benchmarking elaboration to this section.
* Consider moving profiling profiling to said section as well.
* Move Benchmark Variations to this new section.

Chapter Background:
* Under background, each graphics virtualization methodology is described briefly. Paravirtualization ought to be described as well. Either insert description or refer to other section in document.
* Sort problems under PCI Passthrogh in accordance to relevance.
* * Biggest issue is that target must be modified to utilize host hardware.
* * Determinism and checkpointing may be difficult (only speculation).
* * In effect, the only reason PCI passthrough methodologies is Linux-only is that no-one has developed Windows support yet.

General input from Opponent:
* "There are some minor issues with the language. The term ”it’s” is used in a few places, where it should be ”its”. The usage of certain expres- sions, such as; “as such, ” - often used in conjunction with the word “said”, are overused in the thesis."

...in accordance to course management:

Add a thesis overview under introduction; summarizing the content to follow in text. "The remainder of this document..."

Consider moving research questions under background to aims and objectives

Other comments:
Possible inconsistent capitalization of words such as Figure, Table, Section, and Chapter. Be sure to look up.
Veronica suggests Methodology - Implementation to be a better title than Methodology - Solution.

If there is time, add a statistical significance test. Not a priority since the results are clear enough.

Don't refer to the study as an experiment.

Elaborate on OpenGL ES in new section under Background.
Also add a section on GPU architecture and why they differ from CPUs to the degree that simulation of GPU-bound workloads on CPUs is unfeasible.

Scatterplot ought feature only one of the sample tests.

Insert ABI generation visualization.
