Add Discussion chapter. This chapter ought to outline the following things:
* VMP and its effects on the thesis
* * There are times when one cannot use vmp to accelerate native code.
* * The devised solution would induce much larger performance improvements when vmp is not activated.
* * Discuss how this may affect the thesis and future work.
* * Elaborate on the following:
* * * Advances in software rasterization capabilities may very well be used in coagency with VMP.
* * * However, when native execution functionality is disabled (such as with breakpoint functionality), accelerating methods such as paravirtualization must be employed.

Additions to future work:
* Amend magic instruction overhead by batching invocations.
* * Problem: one must ensure to copy data in case referenced memory changes.

Add Threats to Validity section. This section ought to outline the following things:
* Move Phong benchmarking elaboration to this section.
* Consider moving profiling profiling to said section as well.

Chapter Background:
* Under background, each graphics virtualization methodology is described briefly. Paravirtualization ought to be described as well. Either insert description or refer to other section in document.
* Sort problems under PCI Passthrogh in accordance to relevance.
* * Biggest issue is that target must be modified to utilize host hardware.
* * Determinism and checkpointing may be difficult (only speculation).
* * In effect, the only reason PCI passthrough methodologies is Linux-only is that no-one has developed Windows support yet.

Related work:
* Consider moving chapter until after Background in accordance to advice given by opponent.

Appendix:
* Move advanced functionality discussion to new discussion chapter.

Acknowledgement:
* Don't forget to acknowledge Opponent Alexander Mohlin for his contribution to the thesis.

General input from Opponent:
* "There are some minor issues with the language. The term ”it’s” is used in a few places, where it should be ”its”. The usage of certain expres- sions, such as; “as such, ” - often used in conjunction with the word “said”, are overused in the thesis."
