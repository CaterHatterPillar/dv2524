Introduction, or corresponding chapter wherein we specify the importance of graphics acceleration:
* Hardware assisted acceleration especially important when not utilizing host virtualization extensions.
* Advances in software rasterization capabilities may very well be used in coagency with VMP.

Additions to future work:
* Amend magic instruction overhead by batching invocations.
* * Problem: one must ensure to copy data in case referenced memory changes.
* Perform study without utilizing host virtualization extensions.

Add Threats to Validity section. This section ought to outline the following things:
* Move Phong benchmarking elaboration to this section.
* Consider moving profiling profiling to said section as well.

Chapter Background:
* Under background, each graphics virtualization methodology is described briefly. Paravirtualization ought to be described as well. Either insert description or refer to other section in document.
* Sort problems under PCI Passthrogh in accordance to relevance.
* * Biggest issue is that target must be modified to utilize host hardware.
* * Determinism and checkpointing may be difficult (only speculation).
* * In effect, the only reason PCI passthrough methodologies is Linux-only is that no-one has developed Windows support yet.
