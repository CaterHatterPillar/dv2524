Introduction, or corresponding chapter wherein we specify the importance of graphics acceleration:
* Hardware assisted acceleration especially important when not utilizing host virtualization extensions.
* Advances in software rasterization capabilities may very well be used in coagency with VMP.

Additions to future work:
* Amend magic instruction overhead by batching invocations.
* * Problem: one must ensure to copy data in case referenced memory changes.
* Perform study without utilizing host virtualization extensions.

Add Threats to Validity section. This section ought to outline the following things:
* Move Phong benchmarking elaboration to this section.
* Consider moving profiling profiling to said section as well.
* Move Benchmark Variations to this new section.

Chapter Background:
* Under background, each graphics virtualization methodology is described briefly. Paravirtualization ought to be described as well. Either insert description or refer to other section in document.
* Sort problems under PCI Passthrogh in accordance to relevance.
* * Biggest issue is that target must be modified to utilize host hardware.
* * Determinism and checkpointing may be difficult (only speculation).
* * In effect, the only reason PCI passthrough methodologies is Linux-only is that no-one has developed Windows support yet.

Related work:
* Consider moving chapter until after Background in accordance to advice given by opponent.

General input from Opponent:
* "There are some minor issues with the language. The term ”it’s” is used in a few places, where it should be ”its”. The usage of certain expres- sions, such as; “as such, ” - often used in conjunction with the word “said”, are overused in the thesis."

...in accordance to course management:
---

Add a thesis overview under introduction; summarizing the content to follow in text. "The remainder of this document..."

Consider moving research questions under background to aims and objectives

Other comments:
Possible inconsistent capitalization of words such as Figure, Table, Section, and Chapter. Be sure to look up.
Veronica suggests Methodology - Implementation to be a better title than Methodology - Solution.

...in accordance to advisor during meeting:

Move profiling appendix content into section 9.1.

If there is time, add a statistical significance test. Not a priority since the results are clear enough.

Research questions ought be changed. Keep the first one, but replace the others with the following:
* What would consist a viable implementation
* How does the performance relate to software rasterization.
The rest of the current research questions ought be kept as 'discussion' questions.

Add some descriptory text in the caption of the overview figure.

In the context of the List of Terms, the index may seem redundant. Remove the index.

References ought carry preceeding spaces.

Inconsistent paragraphs. Keep indents or double newline. Don't do both.

Don't refer to your proposal. It carries no academic relevance.

dv2549 may be put in web references.

Remove further reading.

Elaborate on OpenGL ES in new section under Background.
Also add a section on GPU architecture and why they differ from CPUs to the degree that simulation of GPU-bound workloads on CPUs is unfeasible.

Background and Related Work ought be combined into a new chapter.
Simics with its corresponding attribute chapters should be made into a new chapter.

Memory Table Traversal should be renamed Page Table Traversal.

The occurence of a preface describing document structure allows you to keep capitilizing new terminology rather than having them in italics.
