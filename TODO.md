# TODO.md
	
Proposed Titles:
* Paravirtualization of OpenGL ES in Simics
* Paravirtualization of Graphics APIs in the Simics Full-system Simulator
* Achieving Graphics Acceleration by Paravirtualization in the Simics Full-system Simulator
* Paravirtualization of Graphics APIs in Virtual Platforms

Bib-Digital Jazz, Man:
* Is papers:bergan:2011 published in anything? Move to 'unpublished'-bib?
* Is magazines:bartholomew:2006 really a scientific journal entry?
* Can more information be found concerning the journals:holzmann:1997 entry into the Dr. Dobb's journal?
* Rename Paper-references to Unpublished or similar?

ToConsiderIst:
* Index section.
* Double column ToC and References.

ToDoIst:
* Section explaining formatting, bibliography styles and motivations of document. Additionally, how different types of citations are written ought to be explained.
* Section detailing the differences in-between emulation and simulation, in addition to terms and concepts being used interchangeably.
* Nomenclature Section to describe code names for solutions.
* Terminology Section to describe concepts mentioned throughout the report AKA Glossary.
* Further Reading Section to guide the reader to more material on the subject (AKA non-valid references and technical documentation).
* Command to format numbers.
* Seperate web-bibliography from the rest by using another bibliography standard. Which bibliography standard?
* For cites that specify no pages; make them refer to a further reading section instead.
* Make bibliographies more compact.
* Make Table of Contents more compact.
* Command to format pages in citations.
* Include Intel-logo on the frontpage of the document.
* Seperate Web-references into seperate bibliographies depending on source material (e.g. blog articles, technical documents, etc.).
* Select keywords in accordance to ACM: http://www.acm.org/about/class/ (using either the 1998- or 2012 revision)
* Rename bibliography-entries in accordance to a certain standard for better overview.
* Review all web-sources.
* Commands defined in dv2524commands.tex ought to have a standardized prefix.
