	Abstract 	= {This article shares the author's insights on virtual approaches to advanced system development and testing. To implement a virtual approach, a software model of the system, known as "a virtual platform," is built and run on an underlying simulation environment. The virtual platform must have both fidelity and performance. To be effective, the virtual platform must simulate the system being designed and the surrounding environment in order to model real-world use. It is noted that past attempts at virtualization failed because performance fell short. Today, technical improvements in simulation techniques and the availability of inexpensive high-performance personal computers make virtualization the approach of choice over hardware-based methods.},
