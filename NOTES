Advanced functionality

Deterministic Execution
---

Acceleration by the means of paravirtualization incurs Host dependencies
* Hardware GPU floating point accuracy (less of an issue since double floating point precision became commonplace around 2007)
* Software API conformance (API specification not necessarily strict)
* Often not an issue since graphics is, albeit general purpose processing is becoming increasingly more commonplace, commonly used only to display some data
* Example

Checkpointing
---

Requires efficient framework functionality to store and restore system states
Probable to be highly platform dependant in terms of efficiency
Implemented using OpenGL in QEMU
Memory transparency in modern APIs (such as CUDA) may advance the Checkpoint/Restart scheme in virtual platforms
Experimental checkpointing schemes have been developed for CUDA (see Guo et al.)

Reverse Execution
---

Currently the window is placed in the host system
In a productification, it is probable that a client might wish for the window to be present in the target system
If so, the framebuffer would be present in target memory
If so, reverse execution functionality ought to include said memory in checkpoints; accomodating for reverse execution graphics
