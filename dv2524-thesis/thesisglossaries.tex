% Sets up utilization of [glossaries] package.
% Mustn't be included before [hyperref] package.

% Package options:
% nosuper - prevent the glossaries package from automatically loading the glossary-long or glossary-super packages. Prevents us from using any of the glossary styles defined in those packages. Used to avoid unresolved compilation error shown below:
% | ! LaTeX Error: Command \tablehead already defined.
% |               Or name \end... illegal, see p.192 of the manual.
% | See http://www.dickimaw-books.com/cgi-bin/faq.cgi?action=view&categorylabel=glossaries#nostyles for more information.
% nonumberlist - don't display the pages in which the term is used after definition in glossary. Put in place because page numbers were erronous.
% acronym - Seperate acronym list.
% toc - Include in table of contents.

% Glossary styles:
% See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
% altlist - inserts newline after term and indents description
% altlistgroup or listgroup - group adds grouping based on the first letters of the terms
% altlisthypergroup or listhypergroup - hyper adds an hyperlinked 'index' at the top of each glossary to jump to a group

\usepackage[nosuper, nonumberlist, acronym, toc]{glossaries}
\glossarystyle{long} % altlong4col
%\glossarystyle{listgroup} % use listhypergroup if there are many entries.
% See http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/glossaries/glossaries-user.html#sec:styles for more information on [glossaries] styles.
