\frametitle{Reverse Execution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Currently, graphics is displayed in the host system
	\item Probable that a potential productification of paravirtualized graphics would feature graphics output in the target system
	\item If so, framebuffers would be present in target memory
	\item It follows that reverse execution functionality in Simics tracks said memory in checkpoints; effectively accomodating for reverse execution graphics
\end{itemize}
