\frametitle{Checkpointing}

% Requires efficient framework functionality to store and restore system states
% Probable to be highly platform dependant in terms of efficiency
% Implemented using OpenGL in QEMU
% Memory transparency in modern APIs (such as CUDA) may advance the Checkpoint/Restart scheme in virtual platforms
% Experimental checkpointing schemes have been developed for CUDA (see Guo et al.)
