\frametitle{Checkpointing}

\begin{block}{Conditions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires efficient framework functionality to store and restore system states (contestant:\dvtcmdcodeinline{glGet})
		\item Volatility; probable to be platform dependant in terms of efficiency
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Related Work}
	Has been successfully implemented in QEMU for OpenGL
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Future Work}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Transaction transparency in modern frameworks may advance the Checkpoint/Restart scheme in virtual platforms
		\item Experimental checkpoint schemes have been developed for CUDA (see Guo et al.)
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
